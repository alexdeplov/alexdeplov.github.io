## Introduction

As an indie iOS developer, you’re facing stiff competition on the App Store market. Each year, thousands of apps are added by developers from all around the globe. Each of us wants to dominate that market to capture all the money and attention of users. With more apps on the App Store, there are fewer opportunities for each developer. More effort is needed to gather an audience, improve your ASO for visibility, or pay more for advertising.

Going back to 2008 when the App Store was born, it was easier to release something and capture the attention of the audience since the number of apps on the market was low compared to iPhone owners globally.

> Over time, Apple has reset the App Store to zero, allowing developers to gather success and giving them a chance to find their niche. This typically happens with the release of a new device.

First, with the initial iPhone release in 2007 and the App Store in 2008.

Then, with the initial iPad release in 2010.

After that, with the Apple Watch in 2015.

And tvOS in 2015.

Each new device provides an opportunity to be the first in that niche. The next App Store resetting date is set to the visionOS for Vision Pro release. Don’t miss that opportunity!
