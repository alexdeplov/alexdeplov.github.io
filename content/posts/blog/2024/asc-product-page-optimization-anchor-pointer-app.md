Inspired by [this post](https://x.com/designerants/status/1766538274351263959) I decided to try this approach with my [Anchor Pointer app](https://interfacecraft.online/posts/portfolio/navigating_success_11_years_of_innovation_with_anchor_pointer_gps_compass/). The idea is to create a hook with the first screenshot and then highlight features with others, including ["zoom" effect](https://x.com/designerants/status/1796625001556136151/photo/1) per each screen. 

The test ran for 14 days and ended with +7.92% improvement and 40.3% confidence.
