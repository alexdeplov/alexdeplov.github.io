Inspired by [this post](https://x.com/designerants/status/1766538274351263959) I decided to try this approach with my Anchor Pointer app. The idea is to create a hook with the first screenshot and then highlight features with others, including "zoom" effect per each screen. 

The test ran for 14 days and ended with +7.92% improvement and 40.3% confidence.
