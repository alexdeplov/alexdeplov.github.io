With the latest release of iOS 18, Apple continues to emphasize design harmony throughout the operating system with Dark Mode for app icons. It provides a sleek and modern aesthetic that many users have come to love. Unfortunately, if your app doesn't conform to this visual paradigm, users are more likely **to remove it from the Home Screen** to get rid of an app icon that doesn't fit.

When an iOS 18 user enables Dark Mode on their device, the operating system automatically switches to a dark theme for all apps. However, not every app has been updated to reflect this change. As a result, your beautifully designed app will appear out of place among the other dark-themed icons on the home screen.

So if a user really wants to enjoy this new iOS 18 feature, they are willing to remove the app that looks out of place and visually distracting.
