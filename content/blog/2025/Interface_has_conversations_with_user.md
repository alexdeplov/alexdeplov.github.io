When user interacted with any screen main question arives in the user hand is: 
- "Ok, I'm here, what you want me to do"?

Then user scanned the screen and each element speaks back to user:
- "Button: Is it what you want right now?" 
- "User: No"
- "UI icon: Is it what you want right now?"
- "User: No"
- "Another button: Is it what you want right now?"
- "User: yes, that's seems interesting or this is what I want right now!"
- Tap

Of course it happens non-directly. But super quick, in a matter of milliseconds.
