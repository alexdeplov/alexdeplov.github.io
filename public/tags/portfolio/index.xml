      <description>As a product designer with a passion for innovation, I embarked on a journey to create my own product. This led to the birth of the Anchor Pointer GPS Compass, an iOS app designed to provide reliable navigation without an internet connection.&#xA;Project goal In 2013 I decided to release my first iOS app. On this way I asked my brother-developer to help me with this project. The goal was to try to create a unique navigation app using GPS as a core technology with one big advantage, it can work without internet connection by reading GPS signal directly from satellites.</description>

      <description>Project goal As a side project I wanted to create a game that could be used to entertain toddlers. I wanted to learn how to code using a simple and fun project. By the way, this is my first project with SpriteKit as a developer, so I wanted to keep the mechanics as simple as possible.&#xA;Researching target audiences Despite the fact that the game is designed for children under 4 years of age, it was necessary to take into account the adult audience of parents.</description>

      <description>Project goal A friend and client of mine — Tinrocket — asked me to create a new Mac app icon for the new Waterlogue Pro app. Back in the day, an iOS version of the icon was used for macOS, but John (the founder of Tinrocket) set the goal to make it more mature and more &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;How As the lead designer on this project, I started with hand-drawn sketches to get a feel for a new icon.</description>
